## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Category Analysis  
Visualized which **product categories** are most ordered using a count plot.  
➡️ *Observation:* Office Supplies had the highest number of sales.

### 2️⃣ Regional Profitability  
Compared **Region vs Profit** across customer segments using a bar plot.  
➡️ *Observation:* The **East** region shows higher profitability, driven by the **Consumer** segment.

### 3️⃣ Sales & Profit Relationship  
Used a **scatter plot** to analyze correlation between sales and profit.  
➡️ *Observation:* Higher sales generally correspond to higher profits, though heavy discounts reduce margins.

### 4️⃣ Outlier & Distribution Analysis  
Explored **Profit** distribution using a boxplot and histogram.  
➡️ *Observation:* Some extreme profit outliers exist, especially in Technology products.

### 5️⃣ Correlation Heatmap  
Visualized correlations among `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, and `Discount`.  
➡️ *Observation:*  
- Profit and Sales are positively correlated.  
- Discount is negatively correlated with Profit.

### 6️⃣ Monthly Sales Trend  
Created a **line chart** to track monthly sales performance.  
➡️ *Observation:* Sales peak around **November–December**, suggesting a holiday season effect.
